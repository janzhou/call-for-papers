## IEEE CyberSciTech 2017

The modern digitized world has led to the emergence of a new paradigm on global information networks and infrastructures known as Cyberspace and the studies of Cybernetics, which bring seamless integration of physical, social and mental spaces. Cyberspace is becoming an integral part of our daily life from learning and entertainment to business and cultural activities. As expected, this whole concept of Cybernetics brings new challenges that need to be tackled. The 2017 IEEE Cyber Science and Technology Congress (CyberSciTech 2017) offers a common platform for scientists, researchers and engineers to share their latest ideas and to exchange the latest developments and outcomes in their research and technologies, with a broad scope of cyber-related science, technology and application topics. 

Papers for CyberSciTech 2017 should be prepared in IEEE CS Proceedings format and submitted to [https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23118](https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23118).

## IEEE DASC 2017

DASC 2017 will be held in November 6-10, 2017 in Orlando, Florida, USA. It aims to bring together computer scientists, industrial  engineers,  and researchers to  discuss and exchange experimental and theoretical results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the areas of dependability, security, trust and/or autonomic computing systems. 

Papers for DASC 2017 should be prepared in IEEE CS Proceedings format and submitted via website: [https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23308](https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23308).

## IEEE PICom 2017

Over the last fifty years, computational intelligence has evolved from logic-based artificial intelligence, nature-inspired soft computing, social-oriented agent technology to cyber-physical integrated ubiquitous intelligence towards Pervasive Intelligence (PI). PICom 2017 aims to bring together computer scientists & engineers, to discuss and exchange experimental and theoretical results, work-in-progress, novel designs, and test-environments or test-beds in the areas of Pervasive Intelligence and Computing. 

Papers for PICom 2017 should be prepared in IEEE CS Proceedings format and submitted via website: [https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23155](https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23155).

## IEEE DataCom 2017

The goal of IEEE DataCom 2017 is to establish an international forum for engineers and scientists to present  their ideas and experiences  in  the  fields of Big Data intelligence and computing.  IEEE  DataCom  2017  welcomes  paper  submissions  on  innovative  work  from researchers in academia, industry and government describing original research work in Big Data.

Papers for DataCom 2017 should be prepared in IEEE CS Proceedings format and submitted via website: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeedatacom2017](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeedatacom2017).

## Submission and Publication

Authors are invited to submit their original work that has not previously been submitted or published in any other venue. Submitted papers need to abide by IEEE Computer Society formats. Final papers must be formatted accordingly (see IEEE Manuscript Templates). Regular,  work-in-progress,  workshop/special  session,  poster  (short)  papers  all need to be in IEEE CS format and submitted following the same instruction on the websites. A regular, workshop, or special session paper should be between 6-8 pages. A work-in-progress paper should be between 4-6 pages whereas a poster (short) paper should be between 2-4 pages. All accepted papers in the regular, work-in-progress, workshops, special sessions and  posters  will  be  published  in  an  IEEE  Computer  Society  proceedings  (EI indexed). Extended versions of selected excellent papers will be considered for publication in special issues of prestige journals (SCI/EI indexed).
